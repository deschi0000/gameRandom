# Description:

GameRandom is a web app for gamers that helps them choose their next video game.
By searching the RAWG Database, it will allow users to make an informed decision, with appropriate links to obtain the game if they like it,
or start a new search, if they want to keep looking.

# Features:

Normal Search: largest search spectrum, most balanced choice
Custom Searh options (Level 1-3): Level 1 starts with more popular/well known games, Level 3 are older, more obscure games.

Search results:
Title, Picture(either screenshot/promo), Release-date, Genres, Metacritic Score, 
Platforms, Developers, Average Playthrough, Synopsis, Online Game Shop links and Game Website.
The Genres and Platforms are links to redirect the user to the RAWG site for that particular query, should they want to go down another rabbit hole

 - The information given seems to be the right balance to inform a gamer of pertinent information as to whether they should like to play the game or not, with the appropriate amount of resources to store/game websites to pursue if they so choose.

 - The "Lets Go Home" Button allows you to go back an adjust your search, whereas the "Refresh Me" Button uses a little AJAX to refresh the page with a new search.

Doesn't store urls to check against new searches: The RAWG db is large enough and the chance slim enough that if it did happen, it would be more of a small inconvenience than actual problem.
